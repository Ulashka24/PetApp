IMAD assigment 2
Welcome to my very own tamogotchi app. I have developed this app with the intention of making it very user friendly and interactive. This fun game allows you to take care of your very own pet!
MOTIVATION:
The intention of this app is to make it feel as if you have your very own virtual pet to take crae, play and feed.

The code style i have used in creating this game is Kotlin, and it was developed with the help of Android studio.
How do you use the app?
Well it is relatively simple. Firstly once you open the app, you will be idrected to the "first screen" known as the homepage of the game. You will then be looking at
a welcome page with a very cute picture and a button to start the game. Once you click the button to start the game, you will be take to the "second screen" where you will be able to interact with your very own pet.
Once you are taken to the "second screen" you will be looking at 3 texts. Those 3 texts are your monitoring levels of your pets , Happiness, Hunger and cleanliness. 
There will be an additional 3 buttons under those texts where they control how you interact with your virtual pet. Each button you click brings up a photo of the dog with the corrosponding movement.
